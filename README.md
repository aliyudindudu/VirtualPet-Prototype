🐾 Virtual Pet Room (Prototype)
📖 Description

Virtual Pet Room is a basic web game prototype inspired by the idea of creating a fun and interactive virtual pet simulation.
The goal is simple: keep your pet happy and healthy by interacting with it in different rooms. Each room offers a unique activity that affects the pet’s status bars (Hunger, Happiness, Sleepiness, Cleanliness). Over time, these bars decrease, and you must take care of your pet to prevent them from reaching zero.

🏠 Rooms & Features

🛏 Bedroom → Your pet can sleep here to reduce sleepiness.
🚿 Bathroom → Wash your pet to increase cleanliness.
🍽 Kitchen → Feed your pet with different foods to reduce hunger.
🎲 Playroom → Play with toys such as a ball or balloon to increase happiness.
🎵 Music
Background music plays automatically when the game starts.
A toggle button (🔊/🔇) is available in the top-right corner to turn the music on or off.

🎮 How to Play

Start the game from the Main Menu (Play / Credit options).
Enter the Game Room.
Watch the status bars (Hunger, Happiness, Sleepiness, Cleanliness).
These decrease slowly over time.
Move between rooms and use the available buttons to restore the bars:
Feed in the Kitchen.
Sleep in the Bedroom.
Take a bath in the Bathroom.
Play in the Playroom.
Keep your pet’s bars filled to make it happy!

🛠 Tech Stack
